## Week 2 at Bootcamp!

### What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?

#### I would like to be able to create an app that functions fully that can navigate a community website. I want to build an app for my wifes workplace Carnegie Center for Literacy & Learning

### What are you struggling with?

#### I am currently struggling with GitHub a bit still, not so much as not being able to use it, but to understand it in its full capacity and using it through VSCode via the gitpod extension.

### How do you solve a problem? 

#### I always solve a problem by first tearing it apart. I have always been able to solve things better when you break something down in smaller pieces and review everything individually. As a chef would say, all the individual ingredients need to be flavorful on their own to make a fllavorful dish

### What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?

#### I often find that stepping away and clearing your mind is a great way to help get yourself unstuck. You can find an error or an answer to your question easier if you step away for some "fresh air" for a few minutes to clear your mind.
