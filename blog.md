# My First Week At Bootcamp

### [x] Have fun!

### [x] Learn something new!
<br></br>

1. The *first week* at bootcamp was **not** at all what I expected! I was not expecting Git and markdown to be the first thing we learned, but that is mainly because I didn't know what Git truly was. :laugh: I actually expected to be jumping straight into the HTML/CSS/JS portion of the course using the online IDEs that were provided during the application test phase. I am very happy with the way the first week was planned out though, learning more about the developer tools we will be using throughout bootcamp and our careers.

2. I am eager to learn more about these developer tools and how they are going help in our **"Quest for Knowledge!"**. I can't really say that I am excited for any one specific thing at the moment because now that I have spent my first week in bootcamp and realizing the vast amount of information we will be learning and resourcing from, I'm excited to dig into it all! Like a kids first day at the beach, so much sand and water and I'm excited to explore it all!

3. Something that most people don't know about me is that during college I made extra money from a video game and eBay! After World of Warcraft popularized MMORPGs, everyone wanted to get their hands into the industry. I have played a wide range of them from WoW to Guild Wars, but the most hours I spent was on a side-scrolling MMORPG called Maplestory run by a company called Wizet, later known as Nexon. I played this game on my off time at college and would create new accounts that I would then get a character to level 90, which was  desired level to reach for endgame content, and I would then sell the account on eBay. It doesn't seem like a lot, but in 2010 I was making $150 a week selling accounts and having fun doing it!
